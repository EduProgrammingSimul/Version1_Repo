DTAF v2.2 - Robust Optimization & Validation Framework

This major release focuses on a full-stack architectural enhancement to solve systemic simulation instabilities and ensure robust, reproducible results. The core philosophy has shifted from simple optimization to robust optimization, where controller stability across all defined scenarios is a primary objective. This directly addresses the root cause of NaN values in validation reports.

üöÄ Key Enhancements & New Features
Robust Multi-Scenario Optimizers (optimization_suite/):

Intelligent Objective Functions: Implemented new, multi-component objective functions for both PID and FLC optimizers (pid_global_optimizer.py, flc_optimizer.py).

Introduced a massive penalty for catastrophic simulation failures (e.g., NaN/inf states).

Added a weighted penalty for the total time a controller operates outside safety limits.

Added a "robustness penalty" based on the standard deviation of performance across all scenarios to ensure consistent behavior.

Added a regularization penalty to discourage overly aggressive and unstable controller gains.

Comprehensive Scenario Testing: Optimizers now run controllers against the entire suite of validation scenarios during every evaluation, ensuring tuned parameters are globally robust.

Automated End-to-End Validation (optimization_suite/auto_validator.py):

After any PID/FLC tuning or RL training run, the auto_validator is now automatically triggered.

It takes the newly generated controller, validates it against all scenarios, and generates a full performance report, providing immediate feedback.

Resilient Simulation Core:

Environment (environment/pwr_gym_env.py):

Now includes a critical NaN/Infinity detection firewall in the step function to catch numerical instabilities and terminate the episode gracefully instead of crashing.

Decoupled all reward and scenario-specific logic, making the environment a pure physics simulation and significantly improving its robustness and maintainability.

Physics Models (models/):

Enhanced all models (reactor_model.py, turbine_model.py, grid_model.py) with stricter validation and internal safeguards to prevent negative states and numerical errors.

Scenario Executor (analysis/scenario_executor.py):

Wrapped the simulation loop in comprehensive try/except blocks to gracefully handle and report any simulation crashes without halting the entire analysis run.

Professional UI & Reporting (ui/app.py, analysis/report_generator.py):

The Streamlit UI now features a smart dashboard with color-coded KPIs for at-a-glance status assessment.

The ReportGenerator now clearly indicates simulation failures (e.g., printing "NaN (Sim Failed)") and automatically embeds all relevant plots into the final Markdown report.

Single Source of Truth (config/parameters.py): All core parameters, controller defaults, and optimization weights have been centralized into a single, authoritative CORE_PARAMETERS dictionary. This eliminates redundancy and prevents configuration errors.

Separation of Concerns:

The RL reward function has been moved from the environment to controllers/rl_interface.py.

Scenario-specific logic has been removed from the environment and is now handled dynamically based on scenario definitions.

Entry-point scripts (run_optimization.py, run_training.py) are now clean orchestrators that dispatch tasks to the OptimizationManager.

üêõ Bug Fixes
Fixed NaN Values in Reports: The architectural enhancements listed above directly solve the root cause of NaN values by ensuring the optimization process produces robust controllers and the analysis pipeline gracefully handles any residual failures.

Fixed numerous potential failure points related to inconsistent configurations, unsafe numerical calculations, and brittle execution logic across the entire codebase.
